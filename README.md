This is an demonstration implementation of Pandemic written for the open source Saito Game Engine. This version supports 2-player games with limited role selection. The advanced features of Pandemic variants have not been implemented.

The game engine itself is written to work with the Pandemic VASSAL module, a similar open source gaming engine which has made Pandemic available to the general public for at least the last four years. That module can be downloaded here:

http://www.vassalengine.org/mediawiki/images/9/96/Pandemic_All_3_Expansions_1.0.vmod

To finish setting up this module to work on Saito, simply download and unzip the VMOD file above. Then copy the contents of the ./images directory into the "images" directory of this Saito module.

All users please note that game publishers traditionally make their materials available on Vassal to do so under the following conditions:

	1. The game files may only be used by open source, non-commercial game engines

	2. At least ONE player in every game should have purchased a commercial copy of the game.

Please respect the terms of VASSAL usage when using this module. Pandemic can be purchased directly from ZMan games here:
